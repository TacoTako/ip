# Conniving Eunuch project

>Eunuchs do not take the gout, nor become **bald** 🧑‍🦲. -Hippocrates

## Conniving Eunuch whispers in your ear and vies for your throne.

He has _advised_:
- Napolean
- Julius Caesar 🔪
- Emperor Qin Shi Huang
- King Edward II

With his 4-step plan
1. Market as a ~scheming~ normal advisor
2. Manage your tasks for you 😉
3. Lull you into a [false sense of security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po7q0OJS9RQ)
4. Poison 🤮 your food and drink to usurp as the new **supreme** ruler.

Great tool for if you:
- [x] have great political power
- [ ] are trusting and gullible
- [ ] need your tasks managed
